I have packed executable files and platform dependencies of all the three platforms here.

Source code along with eclipse project files are located in dev.

Copy bin/[platform]/swt/swt.jar to dev/150_gfui/lib/ before building the source code by:
ant -buildfile build.xml -Dplat_name=[platform]

Copy the wiki directory in your old xowa here before running the executable file.

Good luck!
